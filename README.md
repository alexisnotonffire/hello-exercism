# hello-exercism
I'm a big fan of puzzles. I've toyed with a few and Exercism is a
goodie. Got a few minutes spare? Just bang in a quick fetch request,
check the readme and settle in. Check it out [here](https://exercism.io).
I'm also a big fan of knowing stuff, and I figured this would be a good
way to start learning the basic syntax of a few languages. The final
thing I'm hoping to get out of this is a better understanding of git.
Treating each language as a feature I hope to get to grips with handling
sections of projects rather than projects as a whole which is my
experience so far.

Unfortunately, while I'm willing to expand on puzzles that made me think
about the answer, anything I knew how to do off the bat will be poorly
documented.

Below are all the languages I've pulled a request for, along with a
chronological list of started tasks with completed ones scratched out.

### hello-python
My favourite. I like code that reads well and Python reads a lot like
the voice in my head. Most of my code practice has been done in Python
but for exercism it's probably not going to see many updates. You'll be
able to find my Python work in my other repos.

Started:
* ~~hello-world~~
* ~~leap~~

### hello-go
After getting the basics of Exercism working with Python, Go was the
next on my list to try. I hadn't really heard much about it, still don't
know much about it, but that doesn't mean I can't write in it.

Started:
* ~~gigasecond~~
* ~~bob~~
* ~~acronym~~
* ~~isogram~~
* ~~hamming~~
* ~~raindrops~~
* ~~space-age~~
* ~~scrabble-score~~
* ~~difference-of-squares~~
* ~~two-fer~~
